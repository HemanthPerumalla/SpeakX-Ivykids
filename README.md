# Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a predictive model aimed at identifying customers at risk of churning in a telecommunications company. The primary objective is to help the company take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce churn. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building a churn prediction model using machine learning.

## Project Structure
### Notebooks:

1. Telco_EDA.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook focuses on data exploration and analysis. It includes visualizations and insights into customer behavior and factors influencing churn.
2. Telco_Model.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for building and testing the churn prediction model. It includes data preprocessing, categorical encoding,outlier detection, model selection, training, testing,feature importance and evaluation.


## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is available here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.

## Reports:
Telco_Report.md: This markdown file serves as the main documentation for the project. It includes explanations of the chosen model, EDA findings, feature importance,Models,process, evaluation results in the project.


All Python code used in the notebooks is organized and available in the respective notebook files.
